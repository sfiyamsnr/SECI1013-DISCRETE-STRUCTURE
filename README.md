# SECI1013-DISCRETE-STRUCTURE

### Reflection of this course 
Learning about discrete structures in the classroom has been similar to learning the inner workings of computers' minds. We explored concepts such as sets, logic, and graphsâ€”the fundamental instruments used by computers to solve problems. Comprehending this material is akin to learning the fundamentals of a computer-readable language. I found that these concepts are similar to a step-by-step manual for problem-solving when I applied them to actual scenarios. This exploration of the fundamental components of computers has been interesting!
